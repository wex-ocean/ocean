# Ganesh Bahadur Thapa — Portfolio (Static Template)
A modern, clean, responsive portfolio template (HTML/CSS/JS) designed for a WordPress Developer.

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customize
- Edit content in `index.html`.
- Update styles in `css/styles.css`.
- Update interactions/animations in `js/main.js`.
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/`.

## Notes for WordPress
This structure is intentionally easy to port into a WordPress theme later (section IDs, reusable classes, and minimal JS).
